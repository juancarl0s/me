## Intro

Hi, I'm Juan, a software engineer who loves working
on backend systems. I mostly work using Go, Postgresql and
Kafka but I enjoy exploring new technologies, especially
those that simplify solutions for whatever problem
Iâ€™m trying to tackle at the moment. Originally from Caracas, Venezuela,
I'm now a US citizen who's always up for learning new things.
